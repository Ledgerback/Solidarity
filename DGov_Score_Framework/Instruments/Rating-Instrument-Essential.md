## Disclaimer

The Rating Instrument has not been tested nor validated by the Solidarity Project research group by any generally accepted means of doing so, as of writing. 

This Rating Instrument is still in the development stage and should be used with absolute caution. 

Do not rely on the results of this instrument for any future course of action, including without limitation, any legal-, financial-, or career-related courses of action.

For anyone who want to test and validate the instrument, please do so and report your findings to us by leaving a comment or creating a pull request on our [Github](https://github.com/Ledgerback/Solidarity-Project/tree/master/DGov_Score_Framework/Instruments) repository.

## Proposals

- Change the name from *Rating Instrument* to *Assessment Instrument*
- Add a threshold level for organizations to receive a DGov certification (i.e., certified DGov)
- Questionnnaire for members of Organization (will ask more probing questions and require disclosure statement), while Assessmnet is for non-member of an Organization
- Add option for others to add DGov Score to their own dashboards
- Consider replacing Likert-scale questions with exemplary answers
- Add Cooperatives as a preferred bias
- Add Reputation Mechanisms to Collaborative Governance section

## Orientation

- Organizational Forms
    - Self-Management Organizations
    - Community Organizations
    - Cooperatives
- Information
    - Transparency

## Project Management Board

Please refer to the [DGov Score Framework Project Management Board](/FYckXs4AQbqslTqEiHnzgA) for task lists and volunteer opportunities.

## Current Step

Reformatting the questions into proper order and adding more exemplary answers.

Reducing number of questions to ~40-80.

Removing questions that are in ``` code ```

Reducing categories to:

***---JS: If we're going to go with something like a DGov Idealtype(which I think we should, we should have a short writeup for it.***
- collab governance, 
- compliance and transparency, 
- organization identity, 
    - history should also be included
- Web3, 
- Goal attainment, and 
- Member growth
```
Can probably remove Goal attainment
```
Should also mention the type of organiztion and its primary market. ***---JS:Agreed***

Re-arranging and removing duplicitous or too similar questions. 


## Purpose

Instrument for assessing the distributed governance practices of digital/internet-native organizations utilizing the DGov Score Framework V0.5's Intra-firm modules, based on four impact areas for Distributed Governance:

1. Collaborative Governance
2. Compliance & Transparency
3. Organization Identity
4. Member Growth
5. **Unorganized** (Questions that need to be organized in one of the 4 above categories or a new category)

This instrument will produce a rating (i.e., a score) for organizations based on the following intra-firm modules:

- Organization Dimensions;
- Organization Typology; and
- Human-centric Management.

***---JS: We definitely need to do a writeup for this aspect***

The instrument will primarily be based on multiple-choice (single or multiple answers) questions. 

## Instructions

1. Only one answer per question unless stated otherwise. 
2. Refer to the Definitions section if a term is unclear.
3. Only refer to the terms as defined in Definitions. Do not refer to any third-party source for the definition of a term already defined in this instrument.

## Definitions
|Terms  | Definitions|
|-------|-------|
|All rights reserved | Absolute restrictions on the use of outputs|
| Community reputation  |A reputation determined by the totality of the peers (i.e., community), that can be formulated in multiple ways. For example, the community reputation could be some amalgamation of the peer scores, or the peer reputation scores amalgamated with the functional reputation scores|
| Departments | Existence of formal and informal divisions within an organization. |
|External Stakeholders | External stakeholders means stakeholders who are not Members of the Organization but are still a core constituency. For example, the customers of a company.|
|Formalization | The extent to which organizational policies, practices, and ways of completing tasks are standardized|
|Free | No restrictions whatsoever on the use of outputs|
|Functional reputation | A reputation determined based on a peer's performance on a specific function (e.g., participation in governance)|
| Internal Stakeholders |  Stakeholders who are Members of the Organization and have influence within the organization. For example, the employees of a company. |
| Hierarchical| Supervisors in higher units have absolute authority over the decision-making, conflict resolution, information flows, power and resource allocation authority of a subordinate team’s actions in lower units |
|Horizontal Relationships | a relationship of peers in the same function where one may have authority over other(s) of the same function|
|Managers| A Member of the Organization who has a subordinate(s) or is tasked with overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Organization |
| Member| A person or organization (i.e., natural or artificial person) that is affiliated with an Organization by fulfilling the requirements for membership, ownership or employment relationship|
|Multi-sig | An account or wallet that requires more than one signature to execute a transaction. Additionally, a multi-sig may refer to a smart contract that controls another smart contract, primarily for the safekeeping of funds, that requires more than one signature to execute a transaction.|
|Network Congestion| When a network’s (often a blockchain or another p2p network) functioning significantly slows down because of more than usual traffic on the network |
|Newcomer | A Member who has recently joined the Organization and has been affiliated with the Organization for less than 6 months|
| Newcomer Joining Rate | The rate that Newcomers join the Organization over the past year|
| Ongoing Member | a Member who has been affiliated with the Organization for more than 6 months |
|Open Source | Some restrictions on the use of outputs (generally restrictions require attribution, use for non-commercial purposes) |
|Operational Jurisdiction| Where the primary place of business is for the Organization.|
|Peer reputation| A reputation determined on a peer-to-peer basis where peers rate the reputation of each other directly|
|Radical Decentralization | Teams have the full authority to make key decisions about tasks and resource allocation, top management has few, if any, authority to make key decisions, supervisor-subordinate relationship is abolished, and decentralization of authority is Formalized|
| Selective Decentralization | the freedom of the teams has clear boundaries, beyond which they have to seek permission from their supervisors, who also retain the right to intervene at any moment|
|Specialization | the extent to which tasks require highly specific (i.e., specialized) work skills|
| Token | A representation, often digital, of a right, asset, good, service, identifier, or something of value |
|Vertical Relationships| A relationship of peers in different functions where one has decision-making and conflict resolution authority over the other(s) based on function  or the  because a peer is in a higher unit than another peer (e.g., manager-subordinate)|
