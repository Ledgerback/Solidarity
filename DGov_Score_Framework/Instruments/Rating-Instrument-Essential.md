## Current Step

Reformatting the questions into proper order and adding more exemplary answers.

Reducing number of questions to ~40-60.

Reducing categories to:

- Organization idealtype
- collab governance, 
    - compliance and transparency, 
- organization identity, 
- Web3, 
- Goal attainment, and 
- Member growth

## Purpose

Instrument for rating DGov-related organizations utilizing the DGov Score Framework V0.5's intra-firm modules. 

This instrument will produce a rating (i.e., a score) for DGov organizations based on the following intra-firm modules:

- Organization Effectiveness; and
- Universal Problems of Organizing.

The instrument will primarily be based on likert-scale, multiple-choice, and *n*-point questions. 

***Might need to remove some of the OrgEffectivenss-related questions***
## Instructions

1. Only one answer per question unless stated otherwise. 
2. Refer to the Definitions section if a term is unclear.
3. Only refer to the terms as defined in Definitions. Do not refer to any third party source for the definition of a term already defined in this instrument.

## Definitions 

|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|Department| business units dedicated to a specific client, specilaization, or line of business|
|Vertical Relationships:|
|Horizontal Relationships:
|Hierarchial: 
|Decision-making power: 
|Joining Rate| the rate at which Newcomers join the Organization on a yearly basis (i.e., Newcomers per year)|
|Organization| the specific organization of interest you are referring to as you answer the questions in the Questionnaire. 
|Member| an individual or organization that is a member (e.g., employee, corporate officer, etc.) of the Organization.
|Manager| is an individual or organization that is a member of the Organization, usually involved in system-level decision-making, and has one or more subordinates.
|Network Congestion| when the network becomes congested with too many transactions and the transaction fees and/or completion time of transactions is higher than usual|
|Newcomer| is an individual or organization that recently joined the Organization. 
|Principle-agency Problem| First, ensuring that agents act in the best interest of the principle, which are the owners of the Organization, instead of the agent's own private interests. Second, reducing the information asymmetry between agent-managers and the principal-owners|

### Organization IdealType

*Preference for self-mgmt orgs and community-like orgs*

##### Self-Mgmt, Adhocracy, Hierarchy

1. Decision-making Power

- [ ] Hierarchial (Vertical: Hierarchial; Horizontal: Hierarchial)
- [ ] Selective Decentralization (Vertical: Hierarchial; Horizontal: Decentralized)
- [ ] Radical Decentralization (Vertical: Decentralized; Horizontal: Decentralized) 

2. Manager Power over Subordinates
- [ ] Extensive
- [ ] Loosened, especially within teams
- [ ] Non-existent
3. Direction Setting
- [ ] Strict task boundaries and precise instructions eliminate the need for distributing broad information
- [ ] Teams typically have necessary information to make most task-related decisions. Other decisions made at higher levels where the managers have enough overall information for decision-making.
- [ ] Transparency of all key information and active distribution of information to ensure each employee's capability to make decisions that benefit the wholeness.
4. Task Allocation
- [ ] Top-down process where managers allocate tasks and responsibilities to their subordinates
- [ ] Within-team allocation done autonomously; Top-down process for allocation of agents to tasks and major resources
- [ ] Emerges from the interaction between employees who have considerable authority to decide which roles to fulfill.
5. Task Division
- [ ] Top-management identifies the necessary tasks, which are then divided into sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks by layers of management in a top-down process.
- [ ] Top-down process. But within-team task division is done more autonomously, with managers retaining the right to intervene and authorize larger decisions
- [ ] Bottom-up and top-down with top management as well as individual employees having the responsibility and authority to create new tasks.
 
6. Eliminating Freeriding
- [ ] Supervisors responsible for monitoring the actions and/or outputs of their subordinates.
- [ ] Supervisors responsible for monitoring the actions and/or outputs of their subordinates.Within teams employees might be primarily accountable for each other.
- [ ] Employees primarily accountable for and monitored by each other with explicit conflict resolution mechanisms to resolve conflicts

7. Coordination of Interdependent Tasks
- [ ] Standardized procedures and top-down task allocation and monitoring ensure the necessary coordination
- [ ] Within-team coordination typically done through constant communication. Within-function coordination accomplished hierarchically, with interfunctional teams helping the functions to coordinate
- [ ] Within-team and within-function coordination accomplished through constant communication, coordination roles and IT systems.

##### Community, Market, Hierarchy


 
1. Task Division

- [ ] Scope of transacted goods typically set by buyer, division of tasks to provide goods by supplier
- [ ] Managerial decision(authority), centralized
- [ ] Distributed identification and division of tasks by general members

2. Task Allocation: Assignment
- [ ] Bidding/price, decentralized in dyads (can be facilitated by centralized platforms)
