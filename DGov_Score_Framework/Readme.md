## Purpose
The DGov Score is a further formalization of our preliminary research under Project Statis, which we undertook from May - July 2019, and continaution of this work is inspired by the DeFi Score, developed by Researchers at Consenys.

The DGov Score is a theoretical framework and point-based analytic tool for evalauting the organizational design of digital organizations, which primarily exist in the blockchain space. 

The name "DGov Score" and the continuation of work from Project Statis was intially conceived on the DGov Foundation forums.
