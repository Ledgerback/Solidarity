# Welcome to the Alternative Governance Metrics Framework (AGMF)

Welcome to the Alternative Governance Metrics Framework (AGMF) repository (*formerly known as the Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF)*). The AGMF is a project developing a theoretical and analytical framework for understanding and assessing organizing attributes (specific focus on organization design and performance) of digital organizations and digital decentralized organizations (`very similar to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)`) to make community governance and organizational design more transparent and actionable.

The AGMF is a further formalization of our preliminary research under Project Statis, which we undertook from May - July 2019, and continuation of this work is inspired by the DeFi Score, developed by Researchers at Consenys.

# Current Tools

1. [Distributed Governance Assessment Instrument](https://hackmd.io/s/BJdMFJaPI): A point-based, self-assessment tool for assessing the distributed governance patterns and practices of an organization

# Focus

On digital organizations and decentralized digital organizations. 

For infrastructure or base structure communities such as blockchain communities, please refer to Project Historia.

# Topical Areas

- future of work
- organization science
- voting systems 
- decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
- community governance 
- distributed governance
- technology governance 
- blockchain technology 
- decentralization 

# Current Models

## Organization Model

Open systems model of organizations.

## Target Areas
Target Areas:

- org performance (i.e., org effectiveness)
- org design (also focus on diference between dsitribution and decentralization)
	- governance
	- organizing patterns
		- organization classification
	- core technology (based on decentralization and dsitribution?)
		- https://t.co/DnUcuFVBGL?amp=1

### Where Target Areas are applied

Target areas are applied through the  Local-Industry-Global Systems Model since an organization is a system within greater ecosystems:

1. Local system (within org) 
2. Industry system (between org peers, e.g., market)
3. Global system (anything beyond industry)


# Working Groups

With the revamping to the AGMF, we are alos explicitly delineating work on the AGMF into four (4) working groups:

1. Research: developing and answering research questions and reviewing literature on organization science and its intersections with emerging tech and change-relevant movements
2. Analytics: Developing methods for collecting, cleaning, assessing and publicizing data on organizations to better understand them (e.g., DeepDAO)
3. Certification: Developing a program to train individuals in assessing organizations and certifying organizations based on their organizating attributes
4. Applied: Developing tools to apply research and analytics to real-world organizations (primarily for self-use)

## Working Groups

You can join one of the working groups and help us improve our understanding of digital organizations.

To participate, you can fork this repository and add your suggested modifications.

## User Research

You can participate in one of our wikisurveys (a *wiki-fied* version of a survey where you can respond to questions and also submit ideas) below:

- [Which areas are important for determining the effectiveness of a digital organization and a decentralized digital organization (or DAO)?](https://www.allourideas.org/dgovscoreframework)

## Discussion Forums

Talking with us about anything covering the AGMF including DAOs, blockchain, smart contracts, self-management, and many other topics. 

You can talk to us through the links below:
