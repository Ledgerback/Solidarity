# Initial Formalization

We have initially formalized the DGov Score into 10 categories, with components under each category.

## Categories

Current categories are as follows:

- membership (internal actors);
- decision-making protocols;
- governing bodies;
- governance metrics;
- binding documents, rules & regulations;
- principles and values, vision, mission, and objectives;
- external actors;
- organizational structure (e.g., hierarchial); 
- opportunities; and
- history.

Some of these categories overlap. If it is deteremined that the overlap is non-negligble, then we plan to remove the category.

### Components

#### Membership:

- Joining and Leaving Process;
- Rights granted;
- Duties and Obligations;
- Costs associated;
- Membership Classes;
- Voting power; and
- Stakeholders (may be duplicative of Membership Classes).

#### Decision-making protocols:

- Number of protocols employed;
- Tools for decision-making;
- Types of decisions; and
- Number of historic decisions.

#### Governing bodies:

- Number of governing bodies;
- Types of governing bodies;
- Purpose and practices of governing bodies;
- Membership requirements of governing bodies; 
- Presence of advisory council; and
- Location of governing bodies.

- Number of historic decisions.

#### Binding documents, rules and regulations ("BDRR"):

- Number of enabling documents (e.g., manifesto or constitution);
- Existence of BDRR;
- Relative adherence to BDRR; 
- Legitimacy of BDRR; 
- Relative automation of BDRR;
- Penalties for noncompliance with BDRR; and
- Frequency of BDRR amendments.

#### Principles and values, vision, mission, and objectives (PVVMO):

- Formalized PVVMO;
- Existence of PVVMO;
- Relative adherence to PVVMO; and
- Frequency of PVVMO formal or informal changes.


#### External actors:

- Relative influence (positive or negative) of external actors on governance changes or execution;
- Relative presence of collusion between members and external actors;
- Relative possibility for third party capture (e.g., 51% attack or corporate capture);
- Existence of community protocol for external actors; 
- Relative acceptance of ideas, contributions and critiques by external actors;
- Relative respect for external actors in similar fields; 
- Relative respect for external actors in dissimilar fields;
- Existence of global communication channels; and
- Existence of brand guide. 

#### Organizational structure (e.g., hierarchial):

- Relative level of hierarchy;
- Types of governance systems (e.g., sociocracy, holacracy);
- Relative practice of democratic governance systems (e.g., sociocracy) (maybe duplicative of component above);
- Relative promotion of collaboration among members; and
- Type of organizational culture.

#### Opportunities:

- Probability of being allocated greater responsibilities;
- Probability of being allocated greater voting power;
- Potential for growth within the organization; and
- Potential for growth outside the organization.

#### History:

- Number of significant events;
- Number of significant cultural changes;
- Age of the organization; 
- First-mover; 
- Activity level of the Founder(s);
- Major changes in leadership; and
- Number of rebrands of the organization.

### Scoring

The scoring for the components will be based on a 10-point scale for a grand total of 90 points. 

Each category is scored from 1 - 9. 

In scoring the categories, please assess the components in making your decision on a scale from 1 - 9, with 1 being "very negative," 2 - 4 is "negative," 5 being "neutral," 6 - 8 is "positive,' and 9 being "very positive." With component scoring, use the average score (score total / number of subcomponents)

#### Sample scoring based on the following situation for PVVMO:

#### Principles and values, vision, mission, and objectives (PVVMO):

- PVVMO is not formalized (negative)(score: 3);
- PVVMO does exist (positive) (score: 6);
- High rate of adherence among members and governing bodies to PVVMO (positive) (score: 8); and
- PVVMO has only been formally changed once (very positive) (score: 9).

In this situation, a score of (26 / 4) = 6.5 would be granted for the PVVMO category.

## Second Revised Formalization

In this revised formalization, the components describe above will be used in conjunction with the organizational dimensions, capacity, and effectiveness (part of the 3-step framework)

I am adding 4-5 dimensions from the organizational design/structure literature to the DGov Score Framework, in addition to the components discussed above.

### Organizational Dimensions 

Organizational dimensions derived from:

Holotiuk, Friedrich; Beimborn, Daniel; and Jentsch, Christian, “THE DETERMINANTS AND ROLE OF AGILITY IN DIGITAL ORGANIZATIONS” (2018). Research Papers. 182. https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2018_rp/182; and
Meijaard, J., Brand, M., & Mosselman, M. (2005). Organizational Structure and Performance in Dutch small Firms. Small Business Economics, 25, 83-96. https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.j.brand/SBE_2005_organizational_structure.pdf

The dimensions are as follows:

- decentralization: "the locus of authority in decision-making"
- formalization: “relevance of codes and procedures for coordination”
- integration/coordination: "describes the degree to which organizations coordinate activities between individuals and functions through   formal coordination mechanisms "
- specialization /complexity: “degree of functional professionalism and expertise in tasks”
- departmentalization: “specialized units oriented towards specific markets, projects, and clients”

### Organizational Effectiveness 

And an interesting discussion on organization effectiveness from Holotiuk et al. and Leah L. Fitchett (thoughts on adding this as well?):

- Organizational Capacity (not necessarily effectiveness but is an interrelated concept)
- Accounting measures (objective) (generally capital assets and resources)
- Different types of capital (e.g., social capital and political capital)
- Financial market measures (objective)
- Strategic growth (subjective) (growth in comparison to competitors)
- Client satisfaction (subjective) (whether clients are satisfied with Org’s offerings)
- Goal-attainment (outcomes pursuant to self-proposed goals and/or its mission) (also types of outcomes)
- Objectives and Strategies pursuant to the objectives
- Reputation (public recognition and social trust)
- Member engagement and leadership development (may not be needed here)

Based on Fitchett, L.L. (2019). The Roles of Local Organizations in Collaborative Resource Governance: A Qualitative Case Study of Lake Associations. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/181f/05122f83102bac4cfb931b4fcfae15217c60.pdf

### 3-Step Framework 

After including both organizational design and organizational effectiveness, the framework can be redesigned so that the framework is applied in a 3-step manner:

1. Determine where the organization falls under the organizational dimensions (use components as needed);
2. Determine the (mission, capacity, objectives) of the organization (use components as needed); and
3. Determine the effectiveness of the organization (use components as needed).

The 3-step process based on Fitchett, L.L. (2019). The Roles of Local Organizations in Collaborative Resource Governance: A Qualitative Case Study of Lake Associations. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/181f/05122f83102bac4cfb931b4fcfae15217c60.pdf

### Components

The components described in the earlier section should be used in conjunction with the 3-step process. The components should make it easier to judge (and to make a score thereof) organizations in each step and leaves some wiggle room for the user to inject their own subjectivity. 

For example, PVVMO can be used in Step 2 of the 3-step process. 


## Eventual Goals

After formalizing the DGov Score framework, we intend to turn our findings into a full-fledged paper that should be easily digestable so other can apply the DGov Score framework to their target organizations.

We expect the paper to go over our choices of categories and components, and a sample analysis of a project.

# Third Revised Formalization

Instead of a three-step procedure with separate scores, we can try a meta-score framework (similar to [meta-critic](https://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores)). Wikipedia reference to weighted-average: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Basic_example

Current thoughts on the weighted average formula is the following:

> summation of metric_score * number_of_components / summation_of_metric_scores

In the meta-score framework, an individual scores an organization on each metric (using components as needed), and then the individual applies a weighted average formula on the individual score for each metric, thus resulting in one overall score for an organization. This will provide the score from an individual standpoint. 

To then determine a meta-score, we can try three possible approaches. First, we can aggregate the individual scores into a meta-score by applying a weighted average formula and compare (i.e., see the correlation) the score against a *reference individual's score*. Second, we can determine the correlation between individual scores and the weighted-average formula applied to highly correlated metrics (i.e., individual scoring of each metric).  Third, we can collect individual scores and use the median score as the meta-score.

So let's say our meta-score is a framework comprised of  *n+1* metrics, then a couple questions arise. What *weights,* if any, do we assign to individual metrics? *How many* metrics to include?  

The metrics we have thought of before are:

* Organization Dimensions;
* Mission, Capacity, and Objectives; and
* Organization Effectiveness. 

The current scale for each metric is a 9-point scale, with the components utilized for determining the point total on the scale.

Our investigation into DAOs has led to the differentiation between Organization Technology (OrgTech) and Distributed Governance (DGov). I think OrgTech will fall under how an organization handles the four fundamental problems of organizing, while DGov will fall under Organization Design Ideal Types.

Additionally, my short dive into the organization design literature has uncovered organization-specific inquiries:

- Fundamental Problems of Organizing
  - Task Division 
  - Information Provision
  - Task Allocation
  - Reward Distribution

- Organization Design Ideal Types
  - Markets (not a formal organization ideal type)
  - Communities
  - Hierarchies / Bureaucracy
  - Self-management Organization
  - Adhocracy

and their associated hybrids [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41469-018-0036-3).

Then, does an organization even qualify as an *organization,* such that there is  “(1) a multi agent system with (2) identifiable boundaries and (3) system-level goals (purpose) toward which (4) the constituent agent’s efforts are expected to make a contribution" [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41469-019-0062-9). Though, this likely more of a screener question than anything else.

Lastly, from my short review of Liberal Radicalism and new methods for Collective Action, we could also include use of novel collective action mechanisms such as Quadratic Voting and Conviction Voting towards the novelty of an organization. 

The metrics for the meta-score framework can include:

* Organization Dimensions;
* Fundamental Problems of Organizing (Alternatively, how does Organization use OrgTech and new Collective Action mechanisms to solve the fundamental problems?);
* Organization Design Ideal Type (Alternatively, does the organization fall under DGov Ideal Type?);
* Mission, Vision, Principles and Values; 
* Organization Design Novelty;
* Voting Power (Banzhaf Index);
* Governance and Membership (by making this its own metric);
* Organization Capacity; and
* Organization Effectiveness. 

An additional component that can be added is *resource management* (i.e., how are resources managed in the organization).

Then components will be determined for each metric. Once enough individual scores are created, we can then apply the meta-score. 

If you have any questions or comments, please send me a message.

# Fourth Revised Formalization


#### DGov Organization Determination V0.4

Determine whether the organization is actually an *organization* (though, not required to see how it is solving the fundamental problems of organizing)

“(1) a multi agent system with (2) identifiable boundaries and (3) system-level goals (purpose) toward which (4) the constituent agent’s efforts are expected to make a contribution" [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41469-019-0062-9). 


#### DGov Organization Dimensions and Classification Model V0.4

Determine where the organization falls under the Organization Dimensions and IdealType (Dimensions  determination is not required if we assume that DGov Organizations exist)

[quote="char, post:32, topic:112"]
The Ideal Types we can utilize for collaborative organizations are community and community-hybrids:

* Community-Hierarchy
* Community-Market
* Community (closer to commons-based peer production, OSS projects)

For organizations based on management style, we can use:

* Bureaucracy
* Adhocracy
* Self-management

or a combination of them.

# Fifth Revised Formalization [Framework Version 0.5](https://forum.dgov.foundation/t/any-interest-in-a-dgov-score-framework-orgxp/112/50)

## Purpose

Framework Version 0.5 will clarify the usage of the framework for intra-firm and inter-firm analyses, and to make it easier for others to understand the multidimensionality and dynamism of organizations in DGov and Web3 overall.

The Framework is intended to be a comprehensive framework for analyzing DGov organizations and should be utilized as such.

Do not use the modules in isolation when analyzing a DGov organization.

## Framework

The Framework is divided into two parts:

1. Intra-firm, and
2. Inter-firm.

Intra-firm focuses on analyzing the internal processes and dimensions of the organization, as well as the effectiveness of the organization as it relates to DGov (major focus on collaborative governance practicies).

Inter-firm focuses on analyzing the viewpoint of external stakeholders of the organization, as well as the organization’s impact on the DGov landscape, and their impact on the blockchain network.

### Intra-firm Modules

The Intra-firm modules (previously referred to as metrics in the previous iterations of the framework) are the following (unchanged from Version 0.4):

1. Organization Threshold
2. Organization Classification
3. (DGov) Organization Effectiveness

The intended instrument to measure the 3 above modules is an all-in-one questionnaire with a 9-point likert scale.

The calculation of the Intra-firm score will be based on a weighted-average formula.

The final score will be achieved once we have at least 5 Intra-firm scores. Once 5 scores are present, we can then determine the correlation of each individual module, and make one comprehensive score from there. Alternatively, we can use the median score of the 5 scores.

### Inter-firm Modules

The Inter-firm modules (previously referred to as the Meta-score in the previous iterations) are the following:

* External Stakeholder Opinion
* Market-Concentration
* Blockchain Network Operations Cost (e.g., percentage of gas fees)
* Wealth-Concentration

The intended instrument to measure the 3 above modules is an all-in-one questionnaire with a 9-point likert scale.

The calculation of the Inter-firm score will be based on a weighted-average formula.

The final score will be achieved once we have at least 5 Inter-firm scores. Once 5 scores are present, we can then determine the correlation of each individual module, and make one comprehensive score from there. Alternatively, we can use the median score of the 5 scores.

### Combined DGov Score

Once the Intra-firm and Inter-firm scores are determined, we can created a unified DGov Score.

For example, we can base the unified score on simply adding the Intra-firm and Inter-firm scores. Alternatively, we can obtain the average of the Intra-firm and Inter-firm scores.


# Sixth Revised Formalization [Framework Version 0.6]

## Reasons for update

The Framework is being udpated to Version 0.6 because we are adding evaluation and algorithmic governance to the theoretical background. 

Additionally, this version will better clarify the difference between the theoretical framework and the analytical framework of the DGSF than described in the past versions of the Framework, which mostly focused on the analytical side. 


## Framework Goals

The goals of the Framework are centered on theoretical and empirical research, education and community outreach. 

The theoretical research goals are to:

- determine the conceptualization of an organization
- determine the types of organizations
- determine whether a DAO is a novel form of organizing
- determine the meaning, attributes and practices of distributed governance and algorithmic governance
- determine governance methods for digital organizations
- determine what is a digital organization and a decentralized digital organization

The empirical research goals are to:

- compare and contrast organizations based on their organizational attributes and features
- determine how to evaluate an organization based on their interaction with their external environmetn and impact on the greater system
- analyze organizations to determine their organizational type
- determine how effective an organization is taking into consideration the goals of distributed governance and algorithmic governance

The education goals are to:

- better inform the DGov community of academic research 
- help DGov community members understand organizations and governance
- help DGov community members evaluate organizations and governance

The community goals are to:

- connect academic and grey literature, and scholars (professional or citizen) in the DGov community 
- connect Future of Work movements with the development of DAOs in the Web3 space

## Theoretical Framework

Refer to the Background Theory.

The theoretical framework covers organizations, governance, voting, ownership, management, member relationships, and other related matters.

The theoretical framework is primarily based on the research literature in discplines related to the DGSF, taken with an interdiscplinary approach.

## Analytical Framework

The analytical framework is for measuring subjects based on some characteristic(s). In contrast to the theoretical frameowrk, the analytical framework primarily draw from industry, community and business analytical tools. 


### Combining Theoretical and Analytical Frameworks (i.e., Praxis Framework)

This takes on a praxis approach as we take theory and attempt to apply it to real-world subjects, and the feedback loops that occur from measuring real-world subjects and feedback from community members and subjects to update the practical application of the Framework. 

The theory provides the basis for understanding the area, the analytical provides the basis for measuring the subjects, and putting both together, we can then understand the context of the subejcts we are measuring and if possible, to extrapolate our measurements to other areas and subjects. 

This combination has led to the development of the Intra-firm (*Internal*) modules and the Inter-firm (*External*) modules. 

The Inter-firm modules can be thought of similar to ecosystem or ecological view of an organization. In this module, we focus on how the organization relates with other organizations and their environment(s).  

The Intra-firm modules can be thought of similar to viewing an organization as an organism or a part of a system. In this module, we focus on how the organization relates to itself through the functioning of its parts. 

For version 0.6, the Intra-firm module will be renamed as the Organization module and the Inter-firm module will be renamed as the Ecosystem module. 

#### Organization Module

The Organization Module (OM) is separated into the following components:

1. Organization Threshold
2. Organization Typology/Design (formerly Organization Classification)
3. Organization Effectiveness
4. Organization Governance (since our focus is on distributed governance, we often term this as distributed governance)
5. Organization Management

We often group Organization Governance and Organization Management together, and this is shown in the instruments. 

The instruments for the OM are:

- Organization Governance and Management Questionnaire (OGMQ)
- Distributed Governance Assessment Instrument (DGAI)
- Algorithmic Governance Assessment Instrument (AGAI)
- Organization Effectiveness Evaluation Tool (OEET)
- Organization Typology Checklist (OTC)

#### Ecosystem Module

The Ecosystem Module (EM) is separated into the following components:

- Platform Governance
- Platform Design
- Resource/Project Governance
* Market-Concentration (think anti-trust)
* Wealth-Concentration
- Resource Usage (encompasses Blockchain Network Operations Cost (e.g., percentage of gas fees) from version 0.5)
- Investment Capacity (e.g., number of fundraising rounds and amount of funds raised)
- Exchanges (e.g., the number of goods sold or services provided, interactions with external parties (e.g., partnerships))
- Community Capital
- External Influence

Currently, there are no instruments developed for the EM. 

If you would like to develop an instrument for the EM, please do so.
