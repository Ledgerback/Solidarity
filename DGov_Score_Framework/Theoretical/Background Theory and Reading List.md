# Theoretical background

The theoretical background of the DGov Score Framework ("Framework") is drawn from the following academic disciplines:

- Organization Science
- Voting Systems
- Organization Design
- Corporate Governance
- Organizational Psychology
- Reputation Systems
- Governance Models
- Internet Governance
- Management Theory
- Decision Analysis
- Sociotechnical Systems
- Evaluation

Additionally, we draw from the following areas in the grey literature:

- Blockchain Governance
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
- Future of Work Movements
- Open source project governance

### Organization Effectiveness

And some more information on Organization Effectiveness models in the literature:

There are primarily four methods for measuring organization effectiveness. These are:

1. Goal Attainment
2. Systems Resources
3. Internal Processes
4. Multiple Constituency [[1] ](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1066736.pdf).

Goal Attainment is focused on examining the outputs of an organization and whether it fits with the operating objectives of the organization, “like profit, innovation and finally product quality” [1].
For example, for a for-profit org, profit is an objective the org should be striving for.

Systems Resources is focused on the organization’s “ability to obtain necessary resources from the environments outside the organization” [1]. For example, the organizations’ ability to recruit competent candidates for positions.

I think the community capitals framework makes more sense to use here because DGov promotes community/civic association like organizations (**Though, most of these organizations are often not dealing with a common pool resource or do not intend to aid in governing a blockchain**).

Internal Processes is focused on whether “the organization is internally healthy and efficient and the internal processes and procedures in that place are quite well-oiled” [1]. If internal processes are good, then " [t]he members are completely part of the system and the system itself works smoothly. The relationship between the members is based on trust, honesty, and good will" [1]. And the information flows are horizontal and vertical [1]. Here, this model relates to whether the internal environment is “harmonious and efficient”, and transparency of organizations to the internal stakeholders by providing “timely and sufficient information” [1] [[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280238361_Organizational_Effectiveness_Models_Review_and_Apply_in_Non-Profit_Sporting_Organizations).

The multiple constituency approach is focused on the minimal satisfaction of internal and external stakeholders (“constituents”) of the organization [1, 2]. For example, how a company satisfies the expectations of its employees who provide a service and users who utilize a service [1, 2].

## Our Conceptualizations
### Organization Science and design

We draw primarily from the organization science and design literature to develop our model of organizations, a digital organization and a decentralized digital organizations (DDOs), and to craft the analytical  measures to assess distributed governance, algorithmic governance, and other areas of interest. 

Our conceptualization of organizations is described in the following paragraphs. 

We view an organization from an organic perspective, i.e., an organization is a deliberately-created open system that exists within a greater system or environment (which is more often than not a complex system) that continually interacts with its environment. 

The primary goal of an organization is: 

- Survivability, and
- Maximization.

First, to survive and continue its exsitence. Second, to maximize its value (value is determined by the relevant stakeholders).

In this perspective, an organization can be described in cyclical model with five parts (cycling from 1 to 5):

1. Input
2. Transformation
3. Output
4. Exchange
5. Return

Input refers to anything needed for the organization. For example, labor, knowledge, natural resources, investment, etc.
Transformation (i.e., production) refers to how these inputs are converted into an output (e.g., a good or service).

### Organization

## Early/Fundamental Findings
### Distributed Governance (DGov) and Organiz[ing/ational/ation] Technology (OrgTech) should be considered two separate but related concepts because DGov refers to the human-centric (or social side) of organizations, while OrgTech refers to the techno-centric (i.e., machine-side, algorithmic-side) of organizations 

DGov should refer to the governance system of transparency, participatory decision-making, non-hierarchical structures (principles and values, structure), with a high level of asynchronous communication, modular tasks, and mostly online (rarely face-to-face) interaction (practices) among organization members. Primarily, the goal of DGov is to increase member participation and commitment to the organization by giving members more say (or equal say) and buy-in in the decision-making processes, and increasing transparency so that members are more informed about the organization’s affairs (i.e., increasing knowledge-sharing and -access among members). At the end of the day, it is about giving people more say and information about the organizations they are involved in and to build a more harmonious social environment (a la sociocracy).

In other words, DGov is the human-centric principles, values, and practices geared towards the blockchain space.

OrgTech should refer to technologies and protocols built for organizational management, primarily on blockchains, to help reduce instances of principal-agency failure, increase organizational management efficiency and achieve associated cost-savings, and increase compliance with internal rules, policies and procedures.

In other words, OrgTech is the tech-centric rules and regulations geared towards the blockchain space.

I believe that DGov and OrgTech should be separated into two concepts because of their different purposes and objectives. Furthermore, there may be instances when OrgTech is used to increase organizational management efficiency, but without DGov practices such as in the case of a very centralized, hierarchical organization that utilizes OrgTech (e.g., Creating a DAO via Aragon that primarily focuses on funding for the creator's sole benefit) which provides greater transparency, but not greater member participation in decision-making.
