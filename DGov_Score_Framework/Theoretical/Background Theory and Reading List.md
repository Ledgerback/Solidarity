## Our Current Models
### Organizations and Organizing 

We draw primarily from the organization science and design literature to develop our model of organizations, a digital organization and a decentralized digital organizations (DDOs), and to craft the analytical  measures to assess distributed governance, algorithmic governance, and other areas of interest. 

For our conceptualization of organizations, we have divided our concepts into four parts:

1. Organization Threshold
2. Organization Typology
3. Organization Structure
4. Organization Effectiveness (this part is analytical)

Our conceptualization of organizations is described in the following paragraphs. 

### Defining Organizations
#### Organic Perspective
We view an organization from an organic perspective, i.e., an organization is a deliberately-created open system that exists within a greater system or environment (which is more often than not a complex system) that continually interacts with its environment. 

In contrast, an organization may be perceived from a mechanical perspective. 

#### Organization Critiera
To discern between groups and organizations, we use the four following elements to determine when a group(s) is an organization:

“(1) a multi-agent system with (2) identifiable boundaries and (3) system-level goals (purpose) toward which (4) the constituent agent’s efforts are expected to make a contribution."


#### Primary goal of all organizations
The primary goal of an organization is: 

- Survivability, and
- Maximization of returns.

First, to survive and continue its exsitence. Second, to maximize its value (value is determined by the relevant stakeholders).

#### Organization Cycle
In this perspective, an organization can be described in cyclical model with five parts (cycling from 1 to 5):

1. Input
2. Transformation
3. Output
4. Exchange
5. Return

Input refers to anything needed for the organization. For example, labor, knowledge, natural resources, investment, etc. Transformation (i.e., production) refers to how these inputs are converted into an output (e.g., a good or service). Output refers to the end product of the transformation. Exchange refers to the exhcange of the output with an agent in the external environment. Return refers to the surplus value from the Exchange that is returned to the organization. 

### Organization Typology

To determine how to classify organizations based on idealtypes (the ideal form of organizing for a particular type of organization; Though, generally not real-world examples), we utilize two properties of organization idealtypes:

1. Institutional properties, and
2. Solutions to the Universal Problems of Organizing. 

In other words, we compare organizations based on the idealtypes to determine which idealtype most aligns with the organization's instutiotnal properties and solutions to the universal problems of organizing. 

We take our idealtypes from the economic literature on organizations. Thus, we have three idealtypes and hybrid forms of them. The three idealtypes are:

- Hierarchy,
- Market, and
- Community. 

```
A description of the above idealtypes is provided below for your pleasure.
```

*Hierarchies are organizational systems where units are ordered such that lower-level units are parts of, or subordinated to, units on the immediate higher level (Aoki and Jackson 2008; Simon 1962). Hierarchical organizations employ a set of structural principles for organizing tasks, resources, and information flows. It relies on authority as the main coordination mechanism as that higher-level units have decision and conflict-resolution authority over lower-level units (March and Simon 1958)—implying that its design is expressed in its authority structure (Simon 1962).*

*A market is an arena in which autonomous parties engage in exchange (Williamson 1996, p. 378) with price as the main coordinating mechanism (Bradach and Eccles 1989; Hayek 1945). The design of a market is embedded in the institutions guiding information flows, price formation, exchange, and enforcement of rules and regulations (North 1990).*

*A community is an organizational form that enables and enhances networking among autonomous and interdependent participants—it entails membership, commitment to shared goals and purposes, and rules for participation (Heckscher and Adler 2006; Snow et al. 2011). Such designs enable large groups of participants to collaboratively solve problems and integrate their contributions in a self-organizing fashion, implying that they accomplish coordination and control primarily via direct interaction among themselves rather than by hierarchical subordination. Work is characterized by self-assignment to tasks and commons-based peer production (Benkler 2002; Lee and Cole 2003).*

#### Four Universal Problems of Organizing

1. **Task division** refers to the problem of mapping the goals of the organization into tasks and sub-tasks.
2. **Task allocation** refers to the problem of mapping the tasks obtained through task division to individual agents and groups of agents.
3. The **provision of rewards** refers to the problem of mapping a set of rewards  (both monetary and non-) to the agents in the organization – in order to motivate agents to cooperate by taking costly actions towards executing the tasks they have been allocated
4. The **provision of information** refers to the problem of that an organization’s agents have the information needed to execute their tasks and coordinate actions with others. Coordinated action requires that enough information exists for interacting individuals to be able to act as if they accurately anticipate each other’s actions (Schelling, 1960).

#### Organization Novelty
Novelty in a form of organizing can be assessed by assessing novelty in its solutions to the universal problems of organizing – in comparison with existing forms of organizing with comparable goals.

#### Forms of Organizing
A form of organizing is a specific set of solutions to the four universal problems that any organization must address in order to exist

### Organization Dimensions/Structure

The structure of an organization can be determined based on five dimensions:

1. Decentralization: "the locus of authority in decision-making"
2. Formalization: “relevance of codes and procedures for coordination”
3. Integration/coordination: "describes the degree to which organizations coordinate activities between individuals and functions through formal coordination mechanisms"
4. Specialization/complexity: “degree of functional professionalism and expertise in tasks”
5. Departmentalization: “specialized units oriented towards specific markets, projects, and clients”

### Analyzing Organizations 
#### Organization Effectiveness


Organization Effectiveness can be defined as the extent to which the organization provides sustainable value (value  ascribed  by  a particular   stakeholder.) through the purposeful transformation of inputs and exchange  of  outputs, while  minimizing harm  from  its  actions. In other words, how effectively is the organization achievining its base organizational goals of (1) survivability and (2) maximization of returns.

There are primarily four methods for measuring organization effectiveness. These are:

1. Goal Attainment,
2. Systems Resources,
3. Internal Processes, and
4. Multiple Constituency [[1] ](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1066736.pdf).

Goal Attainment is focused on examining the outputs of an organization and whether it fits with the operating objectives of the organization, “like profit, innovation and finally product quality” [1].

For example, for a for-profit org, maximizing profit is an objective the org should be striving for.

Systems Resources is focused on the organization’s “ability to obtain necessary resources from the environments outside the organization” [1]. For example, the organizations’ ability to recruit competent candidates for positions.

I think the community capitals framework makes more sense to use here because DGov promotes community/civic association like organizations (**Though, most of these organizations are often not dealing with a common pool resource or do not intend to aid in governing a blockchain**).

Internal Processes is focused on whether “the organization is internally healthy and efficient and the internal processes and procedures in that place are quite well-oiled” [1]. If internal processes are good, then " [t]he members are completely part of the system and the system itself works smoothly. The relationship between the members is based on trust, honesty, and good will" [1]. And the information flows are horizontal and vertical [1]. Here, this model relates to whether the internal environment is “harmonious and efficient”, and transparency of organizations to the internal stakeholders by providing “timely and sufficient information” [1] [[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280238361_Organizational_Effectiveness_Models_Review_and_Apply_in_Non-Profit_Sporting_Organizations).

The multiple constituency approach is focused on the minimal satisfaction of internal and external stakeholders (“constituents”) of the organization [1, 2]. For example, how a company satisfies the expectations of its employees who provide a service and users who utilize a service [1, 2].


# Analytical

The analytical background for the instruments of the Framework arises from the following disciplines:

- Organization Science,
- Evaluation research, and
- Decision analysis (TBD).

Additionally, we utilized existing instruments applicable to assessing organizations and for creating point-based analytical tools. The instruments we referred to were:

- BCorp Assessment Instrument
- BCorp Questionniare
- United States Green Building council (USGBC) LEEDv4.1 and points library
- Organization Effectiveness instrument for nonprofit educational organizations
- [Fitchett, L.L. (2019). The Roles of Local Organizations in Collaborative Resource Governance: A Qualitative Case Study of Lake Associations](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/181f/05122f83102bac4cfb931b4fcfae15217c60.pdf) development of a three-step test for measuring organization effectiveness in the context of lake assoications (and in general for organizations that deal with CPRs).
- Metacritic's metascore method
- [Wiki Surveys: Open and Quantifiable Social Data Collection](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123483)

The expected types of instruments we anticipate using are:

- Questionnaires
- Evaluation tools
- Surveys
- Assessments

## Governance
### Collaborative Governance

Collaborative governance is joint decision-making, collaboration, emphasizes discourse, negotiation, and joint problem solving among stakeholders and policy makers.

## Agency Theory

### What is Agency Theory?

"Agency theory posits that the interests of owners and managerial agents routinely diverge and that managers can use the inherent information asymmetry that arises from their positioning within a firm to pursue personal rather than profit-maximizing goals that align with owners’ interests (Dalton et al., 2007; Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976)."

Agency costs are incurred from:

- "losses from self-serving agent behavior and
- the costs incurred by the firm in trying to prevent such behavior."

### 5 types of Agency Costs
1. The first cost is the monitoring of agent motivations to detect and deter self-serving behavior (Ang, Cole, & Lin, 2000; Daily & Dalton, 1995; Dalton et al., 2007).
2. The second cost arises from monitoring a firm’s operations to reduce the informational advantage that agent-managers have over owners and shareholders. For instance, owners can monitor firm operations by hiring auditors to verify the veracity of managerial claims. "Information asymmetry also presents agent-managers with an additional (non-profit-maximizing) incentive to expand a firm’s operations into new product areas or industries to further enhance their advantage since the additional complexity reduces transparency and increases the uncertainty between actions and outcomes (Anderson, 1999; Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997)"
3. The third type of agency cost is excessive expenses such as managerial perks (Ang et al., 2000; Jensen & Meckling, 1976).
4. Fourth, substantial funds are spent on “interest alignment” of the agent-manager to reduce, if not eliminate, the divergence from owners’ interests (Nyberg, Fulmer, Gerhart, & Carpenter, 2010).
5. Finally, unrealized profits from “suboptimal” management (i.e., any non-profit-maximizing decisions or behaviors carried out by agent-managers) are also a type of agency cost (Hoskisson, Wan, Yiu, & Hitt, 1999; Hoskisson & Turk, 1990; Tosi & Gomez-Mejia, 1989)

Task coordination/coordination complexity and principle-agency issues Arises with hierarchical organizations

### Transaction costs
Transaction costs are an important consideration for understanding why some transactions occur in the general market, while others are conducted within the boundaries of a firm."

"Contracting hazards generally push transactions into firm hierarchies, while the absence of such hazards—or the ability to mitigate and monitor those hazards—allows firms to instead conduct such transactions in the open market (Mayer & Salomon, 2006)."


## Voting Systems

### Weighted Voting Systems

#### Banzhaf Power Index
Banzhaf Power Index is a way of measuring how much of a difference a player’s vote can make.

##### Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Critical Player| A player whose vote makes the difference between winning or losing.  |
|Dictator| A player whose power is 100 percent (100%)|
|Dummy| a player whose power is zero-percent (0%)|
##### Example Calculation

Let T be the total number of critical players.  In the above example, T=12.
The Banzhaf power index of a player P is the number of times the player is critical, divided by T. 



## Early/Fundamental Findings
---
### Distributed Governance (DGov) and Organiz[ing/ational/ation] Technology (OrgTech) should be considered two separate but related concepts because DGov refers to the human-centric (or social side) of organizations, while OrgTech refers to the techno-centric (i.e., machine-side, algorithmic-side) of organizations 

> DGov should refer to the governance system of transparency, participatory decision-making, non-hierarchical structures (principles and values, structure), with a high level of asynchronous communication, modular tasks, and mostly online (rarely face-to-face) interaction (practices) among organization members. Primarily, the goal of DGov is to increase member participation and commitment to the organization by giving members more say (or equal say) and buy-in in the decision-making processes, and increasing transparency so that members are more informed about the organization’s affairs (i.e., increasing knowledge-sharing and -access among members). At the end of the day, it is about giving people more say and information about the organizations they are involved in and to build a more harmonious social environment (a la sociocracy).

> In other words, DGov is the human-centric principles, values, and practices geared towards the blockchain space.

> OrgTech should refer to technologies and protocols built for organizational management, primarily on blockchains, to help reduce instances of principal-agency failure, increase organizational management efficiency and achieve associated cost-savings, and increase compliance with internal rules, policies and procedures.

> In other words, OrgTech is the tech-centric rules and regulations geared towards the blockchain space.

> I believe that DGov and OrgTech should be separated into two concepts because of their different purposes and objectives. Furthermore, there may be instances when OrgTech is used to increase organizational management efficiency, but without DGov practices such as in the case of a very centralized, hierarchical organization that utilizes OrgTech (e.g., Creating a DAO via Aragon that primarily focuses on funding for the creator's sole benefit) which provides greater transparency, but not greater member participation in decision-making.
