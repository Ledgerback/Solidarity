# DGov Score

## Preamble

The DGov Score is a further formalization of preliminary research conducted in Project Statis during May - July 2019, and inspired by the DeFi Score by Consenys Researchers.

The DGov Score is a point-based analytic framework for evalauting the governance of blockchain projects relative to other blockchain projects.

The name "DGov Score" and the continuation of work from Project Statis was intially conceived on the DGov Foundation forums. 

You may find the DGov Foundation link below in references.

## Initial Formalization

We have initially formalized the DGov Score into 10 categories, with components under each category.

### Categories

Current categories are as follows:

- membership (internal actors);
- decision-making protocols;
- governing bodies;
- governance metrics;
- binding documents, rules & regulations;
- principles and values, vision, mission, and objectives;
- external actors;
- organizational structure (e.g., hierarchial); 
- opportunities; and
- history.

Some of these categories overlap. If it is deteremined that the overlap is non-negligble, then we plan to remove the category.

### Components

Membership components:

- Joining and Leaving Process;
- Rights granted;
- Duties and Obligations;
- Costs associated;
- Membership Classes;
- Voting power; and
- Stakeholders (may be duplicative of Membership Classes).

Decision-making protocols:

- Number of protocols employed;
- Tools for decision-making;
- Types of decisions; and
- Number of historic decisions.

Governing bodies:

- Number of governing bodies;
- Types of governing bodies;
- Purpose and practices of governing bodies;
- Membership requirements of governing bodies; 
- Presence of advisory council; and
- Location of governing bodies.

Governance metrics:

- Number of governance proposals submitted;
- Number of governance proposals accepted / submitted;
- Number of governance proposals rejected / submitted;
- Number of governance proposals dead or dormant / submitted;
- Number of governance platforms;
- Number of votes / eligible voters;
- Frequency of communication of governance decisions to the public;
- Frequency of releases of important documents (e.g., financing reports, annual reports) (preferably on a yearly basis);
- Number of new members joining over a period of time (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.);
- Number of current members leaving over a period of time (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.); and
- Number of historic decisions.

Binding documents, rules and regulations ("BDRR"):

- Number of enabling documents (e.g., manifesto or constitution);
- Existence of BDRR;
- Relative adherence to BDRR; 
- Legitimacy of BDRR; 
- Relative automation of BDRR;
- Penalties for noncompliance with BDRR; and
- Frequency of BDRR amendments.

Principles and values, vision, mission, and objectives (PVVMO):

- Formalized PVVMO;
- Existence of PVVMO;
- Relative adherence to PVVMO; and
- Frequency of PVVMO formal or informal changes.


External actors:

- Relative influence (positive or negative) of external actors on governance changes or execution;
- Relative presence of collusion between members and external actors;
- Relative possibility for third party capture (e.g., 51% attack or corporate capture);
- Existence of community protocol for external actors; 
- Relative acceptance of ideas, contributions and critiques by external actors;
- Relative respect for external actors in similar fields; 
- Relative respect for external actors in dissimilar fields;
- Existence of global communication channels; and
- Existence of brand guide. 

Organizational structure (e.g., hierarchial):

- Relative level of hierarchy;
- Types of governance systems (e.g., sociocracy, holacracy);
- Relative practice of democratic governance systems (e.g., sociocracy) (maybe duplicative of component above);
- Relative promotion of collaboration among members; and
- Type of organizational culture.

Opportunities:

- Probability of being allocated greater responsibilities;
- Probability of being allocated greater voting power;
- Potential for growth within the organization; and
- Potential for growth outside the organization.

History:

- Number of significant events;
- Number of significant cultural changes;
- Age of the organization; 
- First-mover; 
- Activity level of the Founder(s);
- Major changes in leadership; and
- Number of rebrands of the organization.

## Eventual Goals

After formalizing the DGov Score framework, we intend to turn our findings into a full-fledged paper that should be easily digestable so other can apply the DGov Score framework to their target organizations.

We expect the paper to go over our choices of categories and components, and a sample analysis of a project.
