# Project Historia

An exploratory research project on blockchain governance models. 

Expected output is a short paper summarizing research efforts and making a typology of governance models found in blockchain communities.

For this research, blockchain communities refers to the community as a set of stakeholder groups (e.g., miners, software developers, investors, users, full nodes, founders) and a common pool resource (blockchain).

Our view of blockchain governance primarily comes from common pool resources, the commons and common pool resource management.
