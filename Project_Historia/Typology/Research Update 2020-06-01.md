|Representative Democracy||
|Platform| |
|Meritocracy|
|Liquid Democracy|

## Dimensions and Features of Governance 

- roles
- authority
- qualifications
- priveleges
- rules and procedures

From [1]:

1. "Mission:What is the missionof the blockchain? Who is/are the founder(s)?Are the founders trustworthy?
2. Rights ofparticipation:Who can join?Who can submit transactions? Who decides, or what is the process, to banish a participant?
3. Rights of validation:Who is allowed to operate the validation nodes in the network?  Who operates  the  nodes  today? Are  the individuals  orinstitutions  that  operate  nodes  truly independent and unlikely to collude? Who decides, or what is the process, to banish a node?
4. Data policies:What data is collected? Who can view data? Who decides how data can be used? 
5. Rights of overrides:Who is allowed to submit counter transactions, which essentially reverse transactions? Who  is  authorized  to  roll  back  the  ledger  in  the  instance  of  egregious  errors? (i.e. Who has the power to create a hard fork?)  
6. Rights of ownershipand liability:Who owns the data on a shared ledger? Who owns the software?Who is liable if a law is violated or a regulation is not followed?
7. Software updatecontrol: Who  decides  what  patches  and  functionality  will  be  added  and when?  How are software changes distributed to nodes?
8. Governance residence: What governance, if any, ison chain so that majority-rule decisions are  automatically  adopted  (e.g.  EOS,  Cosmos),verses  off-chain  governance  that  requires human intervention (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum)? 
9. Funding model:  Who  funds  the  project? Who  decides  who  pays  what? Who  decides  the pricing model (including transaction fees)?"
