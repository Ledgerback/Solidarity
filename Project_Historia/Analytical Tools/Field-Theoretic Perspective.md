# Field-Theoretic Perspective
:memo: This is an exploratory research note more akin to an annotated bibliography. No further analysis of this perspective has been conducted at this time. 

## Background
Arising from the discipline of Sociology.

"[C]onceptualizing decentralized networks in terms of:

- resource distribution, 
- power dynamics, and 
- governance ... systems

as fields."

|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|Field| A structured social and symbolic setting in which individuals and groups acquire positions and act, and in which systems of meaning, institutions and hierarchies are formed, maintained and challenged.|

"[S]tructure of a particular field is determined by the distribution of field-specific resources and, by extension, relations among its constituents."

"Decentralized networks can also be thought of as fields that are emerging to compete within broader, incumbent-dominated fields in various areas of economic activity."

*Similar Properties of Fields*

- "Fields initially form when a large enough group is able to establish a local social order (a game worthy of playing, so to speak), potentially to compete within an existing field.
- Competition and cooperation over field-specific resources, including the power to legitimately define and impose the fundamental rules of the game.
- Unequal distribution of these resources and, as a result, structuring into dominant and subordinate positions. This does not preclude a field from having a relatively egalitarian power structure.
- Tendency of the dominant positions to struggle for consolidation and conservation, and subordinate positions for disruption and change. Large structural shifts become possible as existing rules and arrangements break down, often in the context of some sort of crisis, allowing the structure and culture of the field to be redefined through individual and collective agency.
- Tendency of the dominant groups to justify the reality and effects of unequal resource and power distribution, often relying on a set of fundamental beliefs and assumptions about humans and society.
- Relative position in the field has an impact on individual predispositions, although the full meaning and effect of this is not necessarily acknowledged or understood by the participants themselves.
- Tendency to have economically and culturally dominant poles as discrete resources accumulate in the hands of different constituents. This leads certain groups to fight for goals and values that go beyond strictly individual or financial self-interest (often relying on notions such as “fairness” or “public purpose”)."

## Field Analysis

**1. Understanding the formal rules of engagement as defined by the protocol and its governance system.**

**2. Identifying network participants and stakeholders.**

**3. Identifying the resources at stake.**

**4. Understanding the historical and current distribution of these resources, including the distribution at network launch and stock/flow dynamics enabled and amplified by the rules of the protocol.**

**5. Identifying competitive and cooperative drivers, ongoing conflicts and alliances.**

**6. Detailed understanding of governance mechanisms.**
